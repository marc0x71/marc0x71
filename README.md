# Hi, I'm Marco 👋

54-year-old developer who still loves learning new things.

## 🚀 My Journey

Started coding in **C/C++** and **Python** decades ago. Got "thrown" into a Unix project in 2000 with barely any knowledge beyond basic commands. Had to learn **vi** the hard way - it was traumatic but transformative. Installed Mandrake Linux in dual boot and never looked back.

These days, I'm passionate about **Rust** and love sharing what I learn. I was a moderator for the Italian Ubuntu community for years, though work and life eventually pulled me away from community management (but not from the distro!).

## 💻 What I Do

- 🦀 Learning and teaching **Rust** (coming from C/C++ background)
- 🐧 Daily driving **GNU/Linux** (Ubuntu) for development
- ✍️ Creating tutorials on **Vim/NeoVim** and **Git**
- 📹 Running a [YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL75yUkG-fXnv0fkK0zNgsU8malexOdCsp) with a Rust course for beginners
- 🍎 Sometimes switching to Mac for photography work

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

**Languages:** Rust, C/C++, Python  
**Tools:** Vim/NeoVim, Git, Terminal  
**OS:** GNU/Linux (Ubuntu), macOS

## 📚 Philosophy

I believe in learning by doing and sharing what you learn. If I struggled with something, chances are others will too - so why not make the path easier?

Age is just a number when it comes to learning. At 54, Rust challenged me in ways C++ never did, and that's exactly why I love it.

*"That vi editor that terrified me in 2000? It's now NeoVim, and I can't live without it. Funny how things turn around."*
